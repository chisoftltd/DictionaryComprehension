# Instructions
# You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called result that takes each word in the given
# sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.
# Try Googling to find out how to convert a sentence into a list of words.

sentence = "What is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?"
# Don't change code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below:
result = {word: len(word) for word in sentence.split()}

print(result)

# Instructions
# You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called weather_f that takes each temperature in
# degrees Celsius and converts it into degrees Fahrenheit.
#
# To convert temp_c into temp_f:
# To convert temp_c into temp_f:
# (temp_c * 9/5) + 32 = temp_f

    "Saturday": 22,
    "Sunday": 24,
}
